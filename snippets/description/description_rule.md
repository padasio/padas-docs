A rule is a PDL [Expression](pdl-expression.md) or [Correlation](pdl-correlation.md) that performs query matching and/or aggregations on input events.  A rule can have additional annotations (e.g. MITRE ATT&amp;CK Technique IDs) for further processing by other analytics systems.  We've also created a tool for security practitioners to convert existing Sigma Rules to PDL (see [padas-tools](https://github.com/padasio/padas-tools) repo for details).
