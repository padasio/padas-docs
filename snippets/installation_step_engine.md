#### Step 2: Start Engine
1. Start engine node on the console.  The script will ask you to accept the license agreement (enter `y`)
    ```bash
    cd padas/
    ```
    --8<-- "padas_engine_start_console.md"

    **NOTE**: Unless you created all required topics, you should receive a warning as following on the console.  We'll create these topics on the next steps.
    ```bash
    ...
    WARN  Unable to describe required topics for Padas.  Please create these topics in order to run the engine.
    ...
    ```
