Lookups enrich your event data by incorporating field-value combinations from lookup tables. Padas uses lookups to compare field-value combinations in your event data with those in external lookup tables. If Padas finds matching field-value combinations in the lookup table, it appends the corresponding field-value combinations from the table to the events in your PDL search results. This process enhances the data and provides you with additional context and insights for analysis.
